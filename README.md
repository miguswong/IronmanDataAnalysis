Competing in Ironman competitions is at an all-time high for younger age groups. Both 18-24 and 25-29 age groups had more participants in 2024 compared to any year previously; including 2014 when Ironman was at the height of its popularity.

<!-- TOC --><a name="recommendations"></a>
## Recommendations
* **Make Ironman races more accessible to younger generations:** Younger generations show a growing interest in participating in Ironman races, particularly the 18-25 age group. While other age groups are seeing a decline, this demographic is expanding. However, the [high cost](https://www.triathlonish.com/p/how-much-does-it-cost-to-do-an-ironman) of participation, with registration fees around $1,000, can be a significant barrier for these young athletes. This financial hurdle may deter many from participating despite their interest.
